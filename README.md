## About
Welcome to the peaceful island of Sunny Palms!\
This map does not contain any enemies, shops or loot. It's just a pretty little island where you can meet the friendly locals and explore the blooming landscape.

It's also a demo map that allowed me to try out a few things.\
Firstly, this island is a 2:1 scale replica of the Eastern Island from the Utraean Peninsula map.\
And secondly, the plants are completely auto-generated, placed randomly using a Perlin distribution, on the hand-crafted terrain.\

## Installation & Compatibility
- This map does not require LoA.
- To install, simply put the .dsmap file in the Maps folder and the .dsres files in the Resources folder.\
  Or put them all in the DSLOA folder if you use DSLOA.
- To uninstall, simply remove the files again :)
- No known incompatibilities.

## Attribution
- The pool terrain was made by Sadowson.
